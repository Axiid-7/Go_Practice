## map

`map` contains a **GoLang** file  `main.go` which is a program that counts occurrences of words in a string.

>Currently It's working on `golang` provided test cases. 


### To Run this Program

Open `main.go` in compiler then open termianl of complier and run following commands on terminal:

```
// This command will import all the packages 

go mod init map

// To execute program

go run main.go
```

## Slice

`slice` contains a **GoLang** file  `main.go` which is an automated program that display image.

You can change image by changing expression (x + y/2) present in *for loop*

```
    for y := 0; y < dx; y++ {
		image[x][y] = uint8(x + y/2)
	}
```
### To Run this Program

Open `main.go` in compiler then open termianl of complier and run following commands on terminal:

```
// This command will import all the packages 

go mod init slice

// To execute program

go run main.go
```

# closure

`closure` contains a **GoLang** file  `main.go` which prints **fibonacci sequence** using Function Closures


### To Run this Program

Open `main.go` in compiler then open termianl of complier and run following commands on terminal:

```
// This command will import all the packages 

go mod init closure

// To execute program

go run main.go
```
